// Swift supports operator overoloading
// For example + sums itegers like this
let meaningOfLife = 42
let doubleMeaning = 42 + 42

// But + also joins strings, like this
let fakers = "Fakers gonna "
let action = fakers + "fake"

// You can even use + to join arrays, like this
let firstHalf = ["John", "Paul"]
let secondHalf = ["George", "Ringo"]

let batles = firstHalf + secondHalf
